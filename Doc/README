A legally made copy of Factorio
Special thanks to the Factorio support team for allowing me to do this

*Personal Note:*
I am a great fan of Factorio, and I love playing it with friends; I would definitely recommend it.
It's written in C++, and has several hours of gameplay, as well as speed-running configs.
I've written this to offer the opportunity to you to play it, even if you can't / don't want to spend
